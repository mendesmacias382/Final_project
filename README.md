# Final_project
#"The theme of this project was football, with the main objective being to analyze a specific collective situation that frequently occurs during a football match: defending crosses in football.

#To achieve this, I analyzed around 250 videos and categorized them based on the defensive zone or individual marking, considering the success or failure in defending crosses. However, the samples were not sufficient to conclude the idea, yet they represent a starting point to increase the sample size and seek more insights.

Regarding the statistics, I used the independent samples t-test, as we have two distinct attributes to analyze.
